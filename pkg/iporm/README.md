# IPORM -  The interplanetary ORM

## Purpose

The IPORM uses IPFS schemas to serialize and deserialize graphs of objects to IPFS and provide hydrated models to its consumer. Optional encryption can be provided to the ORM to make sure everything is encrypted before being written to IPFS, and cleared when rehydrating.
