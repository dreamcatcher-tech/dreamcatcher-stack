## Ongoing Monitoring

The Engine controls active monitoring of what the latest block is, and it undertakes to resolve the hints it gets about there being new interpulses available for it to process.

This service is not started by default, must be switched on, and must also be shutdown to conclude testing.

If the service is not turned on, then the engine operates in local mode only. In local mode it can have some activity injected into it, and it responds to its own generated events and piercings, but that is all. The service is the network.
