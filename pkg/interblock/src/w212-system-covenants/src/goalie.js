        It works as follows:
            1. It receives the user prompt, in context of the entire interaction
            2. Then i determines which goal the user is currently working on, or if they are starting a new goal
            3. Also it determines if the user is done with any current goals, and if so, closes them
            4. Finally it reprioritizes the goals based on the latest prompt
            5. Control is then passed back to HAL, with HALs context isolated to be the current goal only
