# Ipld Schemas for Interpulse

Read the [Guide to IPLD schemas](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas/using/authoring-guide/) to understand the syntax.

Any changes to this file need to be followed by running `yarn schemas` to generate the file `src/w014-schemas/ipldSchemas.js` which is imported by all the Models in `w015-models`

## HAMT

Schemas for the hash array mapped trie used to reduce Network slowness with speed.

```sh
# Root node layout
type HashMapRoot struct {
  hashAlg Int
  bucketSize Int
  hamt HashMapNode
}

# Non-root node layout
type HashMapNode struct {
  map Bytes
  data [ Element ]
} representation tuple

type Element union {
  | &HashMapNode link
  | Bucket list
} representation kinded

type Bucket [ BucketEntry ]

type BucketEntry struct {
  key Bytes
  value Any
} representation tuple
```

## Binary

Special in that it exposes a raw link, but adheres to the model interface for interop with the other models here. Similar to Address in that it exposes an IPLD primitive.

```sh
type Binary link
```

## Address

Special object that wraps an IPLD Link, just like Binary wraps an IPLD Block.
The model includes these constants:

1. UNKNOWN `QmVQEFQi81SSbZaezrm78p333EGeYzfEZyvCnX848KaMCw`
1. ROOT `QmSawJHmTNpaUjDYWCE9RgoHTpKbi6JD7TuGESFbtZ4ZLc`
1. LOOPBACK `Qme2gGBx8EnSrXc5shQF867KPQd4jwubNov67KEKZbo4p3`
1. INVALID `QmYSWwmJ4w1pZ6igGRNKcVHpBU68iaumYEjsdbMpxfAQaj`
1. GENESIS `QmZTKF2kuFHy8isKWXpNeNa5zjeJwsHUbPbTNF1fS8HkpB`

Addresses are always CID version 0, which makes them easy to distinguish at a glance from `Pulse`s and `Binary`s, which are CID version 1.

An address is the version 0 CID that links to the version 1 CID of the first Pulse of a given chain.

```sh
type Address link
```

## Request

Messages for communicating with a reducer.
Requests are always delivered as part of a channel between chains.
These are effectively [Redux](https://redux.js.org) actions, with an addition of an IPLD CID for adding binary data.

```sh
type Request struct {
    type String
    payload { String : Any }
    binary optional Binary
}
```

## Reply

Messages that implement the continuation system.
One of three types. Immediate replies are resolves or rejections too.
Later these types will be extended to implement generators.

```sh
type ReplyTypes enum {
    | REJECT("@@REJECT")
    | PROMISE("@@PROMISE")
    | RESOLVE("@@RESOLVE")
}
type Reply struct {
    type ReplyTypes
    payload { String : Any }
    binary optional Binary
}
```

## Public Key

`key` is the public key from an IPFS PeerID

`PublicKeyTypes` comes from [`js-libp2p-crypto`](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-crypto/blob/125d33ca7db2b7ef666d1c1425e10827a7555058/src/keys/keys.js#L20)

```sh
type PublicKeyTypes enum {
    | Ed25519
    | Secp256k1
    | RSA
}
type PublicKey struct {
    name String
    key String
    algorithm PublicKeyTypes
}
```

## Validators

```sh
type Validators struct {
    quorumThreshold Int
    publicKeys [&PublicKey]
}
```

## Signatures

An array of signatures as `base36upper` encoded strings that matches the order of the Validators list.
Gaps in the array represent missing signatures, which might still pass quorum.
May be CID'd if space becomes an issue.

```sh
type Signatures [String]
```

## Covenant

This is the most important part of the system in setting us apart from IPFS. This model is how we go from content addressable storage to content addressable execution. Covenants are how programmable behaviour is introduced to IPFS, approaching IPEX - the InterPlanetaryExecutableâ„¢.

The Covenant system uses a PulseChain to represent an executable code package, using the chain data structure to capture revisions of the software. This PulseChain may have children to represent subpackages, and may include forks, representing different flavours of release such as beta, dev, and prod. A Covenant represents the executable piece of language specific code and its provenance. By way of parents running `repo` Covenants, the PulseChain may include hash links to the git repos that the code was generated from, strengthening the link between running code and committed code.

To determine what packages to load, we need to be told what chainId to look for, and then which specific Pulse in that PulseChain contains the version we will be running. This determination requires a Covenant Resolution Strategy. In development mode, we override this strategy with developer supplied functions at runtime, to allow rapid feedback.

To be a valid Pulse that we can load code from, we need some minimum information in the state, described in the example below. System covenants are loaded from the chain that they publish from, the same as user supplied covenants, except we shortcut the lookup and load process, and we also skip containment for them by default, instead of requiring config options to skip containment for vendor supplied covenants.

By way of example, the format of the state within the Covenant is:

```js
{
    name: `some-internal-sluggified-name`, // a hint for consumers
    version: `0.3.2` // semver version string
    loader: `javascript` // which interblock loader to use on the binary image
    api: { // the actions api of this covenant
        TEST: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
                anything: { type: 'string', description: 'literally anything'}
            }
        }
    },
    state: {}, // optional starting state of the covenant, may be overridden
    installer: { // any required children are specified here
        customers: {
            covenant: 'collection',
            state: { datum: { }},
            installer: {
                customer123: {} // can load some initial customers
            }
        },
        remoteChain: 'Address(QmYMKzxgro9NTb)'
    },
    importMap: { // specify paths and the imports to override
        datum: 'interblock://privateRegistry1/datum',
        collection: 'sneakyNameChange',
    },
    registries: [ // ordered registries to look up any unresolved covenant names
        'interblock://registry1',
        'interblock://reg2',
        '/some/local/path',
        // referring to a specific pulse in a registry is the same as
        // using a package-lock.json
        'PulseLink(bafyreig3w5cuffzshczi5xzwnp4igna5wehxcisr53jcjtrfxcnbgzwrui)
    ]
}
```

The lifecycle of the usage of a Covenant is:

1. Develop: code is loaded live while the developer makes changes, to remove publishing from the feedback loop
1. Publish: here the code is transformed into a filesystem image that can be loaded up and executed. Code dependencies are fetched here, and build steps are run
1. Resolve: A string in config is resolved into a pulselink that contains a Covenant
1. Install: A covenant is set as the running covenant of a new chain, and any children that are part of the installation are created. Note this may trigger nested covenants to begin their own installation process.
1. Load: A Covenants binary image is reified and within the isolation boundaries turned into executable code
1. Execute: Loaded code from the Covenants binary image is executed within the isolation boundary
1. Effects: Optionally side effects supplied from the binary image are executed

### Dependency Management

Modern code carries many dependencies. Here dependencies are split into 3 types:

1. Code level: these are specified using the package manager that your code type uses. Eg: npm, pip, cargo dependencies and are bundled together during the publish step. Only the loader and the publisher need to be aware of these.
2. Covenant level: these are pieces of code that represent a hash based reference to executable code. In nodejs, an executable is an npm package that has all its modules installed and optionally some transpilation applied.
3. Chain level: - this is a reference to a running chain, and is referenced by chainId. These can be oracles, services, people, or any other object in the chain based multiverse. These are interacted with using their json based API.

Each `covenant` instance is, by way of the chains that house them, are capable of an unlimited number of children. This in effect makes them a registry unto themselves. The code that runs a large registry is intended to be exactly the same as what runs a simple hello world covenant, differing only in child chain count.

Given that covenants are a pulsechain, and interpulse itself is published as a pulsechain, our design goal is that running interpulse on interpulse is possible by specifying interpulse as the covenant of a chain, and configuring the engine to run optimally within chain land. Furthermore the loader can be supplied as a covenant, allowing custom loaders and publishers to be created.

The Covenant System is made of at least two distinct Covenants. The `covenant` Covenant, which is the final step before the binary it contains is executed, and the `repo` covenant, which acts as a parent for the Covenant, holding reference to its source code, lineage, and other published artefacts. Ideally a Repo is a general purpose object used to model all kinds of code projects, whereas a Covenant is the minimum interface we need to be able to use ipfs data as executable code in a safe and chargeable way.

### The `repo` Covenant

A Repo chain represents a top level code repository that is used to produce executable assets of various kinds. In order to not constrain its use to solely interblock, the repo represents any kind of code that is version controlled by git. It will hopefully be able to run build steps triggered by commit, similar to github actions.

Under the `releases` child of the repo, there is another child for each type of asset being released. For npm packages, this child is named `npm`, for python packages `pip` and for Rust crates `crate` and so on. Likely, a build step would have been required to produce each child.

The Repo can have any number of children that are also Repo covenants, which allows monorepos to be managed in this fashion, or other types of relationship to be expressed.

One of the interblock specific children under the `releases` child is the `covenant` child, which contains a chain running the covenant of type `covenant`

### The `covenant` Covenant

Covenants are the way in which interblock specifies what transitional behaviours are needed to model some useful object. Inevitably we need to model covenants themselves, and the `covenant` Covenant is how we do that.

This covenant is duck typed, even tho we provide a reference implementation.
The reference Covenant does not allow having any children, as child relationships must be managed by the `repo` Covenant, which should be the parent of a Covenant.

The Binary of the Covenant is code that is ready to be instantly executed by the isolator, to generate the next block. This is the place where binary data becomes executable code. The Binary is equivalent to filesystem data, that a programming language can load and execute without any remote fetching.

Once the binary image contained by the Covenant instance is loaded, we expect at least one function to be provided, and can utilize up to four functions:

1. `reducer( state, action ) -> nextState + transmissions` (this function is required)
1. `effect( state, action ) -> transmissions`
1. `upgrade( state ) -> nextState + transmissions`
1. `downgrade( state ) -> nextState + transmissions`

Transmissions are actions that need routing to remote chains. The optional `upgrade` function transitions from the previous state version to the current one. It is recommended to supply this function separately from the reducer because it gets different timeout settings, and it can be chained by the engine if multiple upgrades need to occur at once, rather than the reducer having to handle arbitrary upgrade paths. `downgrade` does the reverse, and again is optional. Both these functions will be checked for correctness during publish verification where semver is automatically calculated too.

Note that literally anything can be the executable - an RPC call, a docker image - anything.

### Covenant Resolution System

In each chain, there is a string key named covenant, which states a name to be looked up in the covenant resolution system, and then its binary is loaded to execute the actions of this chain against its current state. This string needs to be resolved to a specific pulse in a specific chain. It is vitally important the covenant system become part of the state system at the earliest possible architectural moment. Otherwise two separate name resolution systems exist with the same purpose - turning bytes into cpu instructions.

For JS we endeavour to follow Deno where possible, as their module resolution strategy results from lessons and regrets they had about the nodejs module system, and also aligns directly with the browser module system. Deeper, we aim to follow the guidance given by the [import maps draft](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#the-import-map).

The purpose of this system is to enable all the covenants of an app complex to upgrade in a single point in time, as each chain in the complex has its covenant resolution status checked before each pulse is made.

Given a pulse with a string as its covenant, the resolution process is:

1. get the approot out of the pulse
1. get the latest approot
1. assert the approot pulse has a resolvable covenant
1. get the covenant string out of the pulse
1. if the string is an absolute or relative path:
   1. assert it points to a valid covenant
   1. return
1. the string is bare, so begin the resolution walk
1. walk from the approot down to the child, checking each importMap of each covenant of each chain on the way down
1. If nothing found, check the registries specified in the approot
1. If still nothing, throw

### Covenant Registries

Registries exist to convert names of covenants into Pulses. Any Interblock chain can be used as a registry and can respond to scale invariant requests for any of its children. These are not actions, but are read requests, where the aliases of children are used to represent covenants that match a name query.

Any resolution system has to go initially from a plain text string and resolve that to something hashlockable. This is a weakness of all resolution systems, from urls, to npm, to pip, to docker, and is a type of supply chain provenance problem. We aim to minimize this problem by automatically hashlocking code as early as possible, and making this so trivial for developers that they need to actively opt out of the system. Further we aim to mitigate this problem by economic incentives provided by pools. Pools will be set up that charge a fee to have assurance that name to hash resolution is correct, and the pools pay out a penalty if they are proven to be in error.

Publishing to an Interblock registry would be as simple as making a chain, and pushing your git commits to it. You could optionally connect this chain to a public chain that we supply to ensure replication and advertisement of your changes. Hopefully we can later implement a language server that will allow browsing covenant registries from the comfort of vscode [Deno handles registries](https://deno.land/manual/language_server/imports)

All this is to say that, the schema for representing Covenants on chain is:

```sh
type Covenant string
```

## Timestamp

Date example `2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z`.
In CI mode, the constant timestamp is: `2022-02-22T02:22:22.222Z`, which allows for predictable chainIds to be generated to take advantage of jests snapshot testing tooling.

```sh
type Timestamp struct {
    isoDate String     # ISO8601 standard string
}
```

## ACL

Will contain a list of what groups have access to what paths, and what actions they can use at those paths. Then, a list of users to groups. Basically copying Linux, so chmod permissions will be stored with the chains rather than in a central list.

```sh
type ACL struct {
    # ACL will be done in a future revision
}
```

## State

CID links inside the State will allow the author to break down their state any way they please. This will not be supported initially, as the State should be kept small enough to be managed as a single object.

The result of running a covenant is stored here, and must be serializable.

State is special in that it wraps an object directly, with no predefined keys.

```sh
type State { String : Any }
```

## Meta

A storage area used to track information used by the system as it manages its own chain and the interactions with other chains. Eg: used to track genesis actions so it knows which action to reply to.

```sh
type Meta struct {
    replies { String: { String : Any }}
    deploy { String : Any }     # track ongoing deploy operations
}
```

## Pending

Tracks what was the covenant action that caused the chain to go into pending mode, stored by channelId and requestId. It then keeps track of all requests made while the chain is in pending mode whenever the covenant is run. The chain is only rerun once replies have been received that settle all the outbound requests, to avoid wasteful rerunning.

Each rerun must produce the exact same requests each time, in the exact same order.

This structure consists of two arrays - one of all the outbound requests the covenant made, and another of all the so far received replies. The reducer should not be invoked until all the empty slots in the `replies` array have been filled.

Replies must be tracked too, else we may retransmit them

`replies` is indexed by the pendingTxs array filtered for only Requests.

```sh
type RequestId struct {
    channelId Int
    stream String
    requestIndex Int
}
type PendingTx struct {
    request optional &Request
    reply optional &Reply
    to optional String                   # Alias at time of invocation
    id optional RequestId       # Not known at time of creation
}
type Pending struct {
    rxPendingRequest RequestId    # The request that triggered pending mode
    pendingTxs [PendingTx]
    replies [&Reply]
}
```

## Config

Entropy is a seed used to provide pseudorandomness to the chain. Initially it is used to ensure the genesis blocks are strongly unique, but every time a function requests some random data, we increment the count, then run a twister function that many times to generate the randomness. The count is zeroed each Pulse by storing the current value of the twister. If the covenant is pending, this count is not increased, but rather the count in Pending slice is increased temporarily.

### AppRoot requirements

AppRoot is a system chain, and contains within it some required config items that can be deferred in child chains. It must also have some extra state.

It holds the registry of what covenant names resolve to what pulselinks. To upgrade a package, this allows every chain in the complex to upgrade simultaneously.

Individual chains may override `interpulse` and `covenant` but if they do not, the approot version is the required version.

```sh
type SideEffectsConfig struct {
    networkAccess [String]
    asyncTimeoutMs Int
}
type Entropy struct {
    seed String
    count Int
}
type Config struct {
    isPierced Bool
    sideEffects SideEffectsConfig
    isPublicChannelOpen Bool    # May be list of approots
    acl &ACL
    interpulse &Covenant        # What version of Interpulse is this built for
    entropy Entropy
    covenant &Covenant
}
```

## Dmz

The Pulse structure is required to be both the snapshot of a stable state and a working object used to pool with and process with. When in pooling mode, it must be additive, in that if a block was begun with one version of the pool, using IPFS to determine what the diff of the next pool should allow a new blocking effort to begin without any backtracking.

An example of where such backtracking might occur if designed poorly is in the induction of Pierce actions. As these are put into a virtual channel, each time they are pooled, a new virtual Pulse needs to be created, to permit blocking to have already begun, then carry on immediately using the next pooled DAG.

```sh
type Dmz struct {
    config &Config
    timestamp Timestamp                 # changes every block
    network Network                     # block implies network changed
    state &State
    meta &Meta
    pending optional &Pending
    approot optional PulseLink          # The latest known approot
    binary optional Binary
}
```

## Tx

A transmission that is destined for some chainId, which might be as yet unresolved.  
At the start of each block, all transmitting channels are zeroed and the precedent is updated. Validators may coordinate transmission workloads by sharing the pooled softblock where they each zero out channels as they get sent, to ensure all interblocks are sent, and to parallelize the work.

```js
const TxExample = {
    precedent: CIDPrecedent,
    system: {
        requestsStart: 23423,
        requests: [request1, request2, request3],
        repliesStart: 3324,
        replies: [reply1, reply2, reply3, reply4]
        promisedIds: [ 32, 434, 435 ],
        promisedReplies: [
            { requestId: 12, reply: reply5 },
            { requestId: 9, reply: reply6 }
        ]
    },
    reducer: {
        requestsStart: 84587,
        requests: [],
        repliesStart: 868594,
        replies: [reply1]
        promisedIds: [ 3, 562, 9923 ],
        promisedReplies: []
    }
}
```

```sh
type PromisedReply struct {
    requestIndex Int
    reply &Reply
}
type TxQueue struct {
    requestsLength Int
    requests optional [&Request]
    repliesLength Int
    replies optional [&Reply]
    promisedRequestIds [Int]
    promisedReplies optional [PromisedReply]
}
type Tx struct {
    precedent optional PulseLink    # The last Pulse this chain sent
    system TxQueue                  # System messages
    reducer TxQueue                 # Reducer messages
}
```

## Rx

Tip represents the hash of the last interpulse that was accepted into this channel.
When ingesting an interpulse, the RxQueue is extended to include the TxQueue that came with the interpulse.
The data structure of RxQueue and TxQueue is identical, but the functions presented to the system are different.

```sh
type RxQueue = TxQueue
type Rx struct {
    tip optional PulseLink          # The last Pulse this chain received
    system optional RxQueue
    reducer optional RxQueue
}
```

## Channel

`tip` matches up with precedent on the other side.

Tx and Rx are split out so that they can be stored on the block separately.
Tx needs to be separate so that remote fetching does not expose the channelId.
Rx needs to be separate to allow the ingestion of messages to be halted at any point.
Both are separate from Channel so that the potentially large HAMT that stores
all the Channel instances is updated as little as possible, whilst providing rapid
lookup to get channels that are active.

Tx needs to be hashed as it is an independent transmission, but Rx does not
need to be hashed.

The structure implements the design goal of making the Pulse be the context
of the state machine that processes all the actions.

Channel stores rx and tx only after all the activity has been wrung out of them.

Channel has functions to transmit actions, because it needs to update both tx and rx to shift the next reply to be processed. In contrast, receiving actions is done by calling the rx slice directly, as no modifications occur.

```sh
type Channel struct {
    channelId Int
    address Address                 # The remote chainId
    tx &Tx
    rx Rx
    aliases [String]                # reverse lookup
}
```

## Loopback

Subclass of Channel that reverses Tx around on itself.
Loopback is never counted as transmitting, but if it has activity on its Tx slice, it is counted as receiving

```sh
type Loopback = Channel
```

## Network

Every channel is given an index, which is monotonic since the start of the chain.
This ID stays with the channel for its entire lifecycle.
Internally, everything references channels by this id, with the advantage being communications are unaffected by renames or resolving the chainId, and when actions are dispatched, a unique identifier can be given to the action sender regardless of the current point in the lifecycle of the chain.

There may be many aliases mapped to the same channelId.

A HAMT is used to track large amounts of data whilst storing only diffs.

Channel is not stored as a link, but as a full object, since inside of the channel the Tx key will be stored as a link anyway, so no point double linking.

Rxs may use a hamt.

Txs are blanked each block, so no need to use a HAMT.

Uplinks should never include any channels that are in the other hamts.

Constraints:

1. same alias name cannot be in multiple tables
1. remote addresses have exactly 1 channelId
1. uplinks cannot be tranmsitted to

Channel Types

1. children - by alias, bidirectional
1. uplink - by address, the rx side of downlink
1. downlink - by path resolved to address, the tx side of uplink
1. symlink - permanent link by path, resolution refreshed each tx
1. hardlink - permanent link by address, acts as a shared child

This does introduce non-determinism, as the timing of when something occurred can now affect what address it was resolved to.

```sh
type Channels struct {
    counter Int
    list HashMapRoot               # Map of channelIds to Channels
    addresses HashMapRoot          # reverse lookup of channels
    rxs [ Int ]
    txs [ Int ]
}
type Network struct {
    parent optional Channel
    loopback optional Channel
    io optional Channel
    piercings optional Tx

    channels optional Channels

    # alias maps to channelIds
    children optional HashMapRoot           # keys are local paths
    uplinks optional HashMapRoot            # keys are channelIds, value=true
    downlinks optional HashMapRoot          # keys are remote paths
    symlinks optional HashMapRoot           # local paths : any paths
    hardlinks optional HashMapRoot          # local paths : any paths
}
```

## Provenance

Basically answers where did the current snapshot of the `Dmz` come from.

A `StateTreeNode` is used to provide an overlay tree to separate the covenant defined knowledge from the activity that the system operations generate while tending to the covenants intentions.

`lineageTree` is a tree now, not a chain, and this link points to the root of the tree.

`turnoversTree` lists all the `Pulse`s that changed the validator set or quorum threshold, to allow rapid validation without seeing every block in the chain.

The only Pulse that does not have a transmissions slice is the genesis Pulse.

WARNING state tree needs to use a HAMT for size

```sh
type StateTreeNode struct {
    state &State
    binary &Binary
    children { String : &StateTreeNode }
}
type Lineage [Link]          # TODO use a derivative of the HAMT as array ?
type Turnovers [PulseLink]   # TODO make into a tree
type Provenance struct {
    dmz &Dmz
    states &StateTreeNode
    lineages &Lineage     # Must allow merging of N parents

    validators &Validators
    turnovers &Turnovers
    address Address
    transmissions { String: Tx }
}
```

## Pulse

The Pulse actual is an array of signatures that satisfy the configuration of the `Dmz` that the signatures sign off on.

The CID of the first Pulse is used to derive the chainId.

```sh
type Pulse struct {
    provenance &Provenance
    signatures Signatures
}
```

## PulseLink

In some places, we want to avoid dereferencing CIDs during the uncrush process.
These places are always Pulses, and so the PulseLink class signals to the
uncrush process not to look any further.

If the program needs to dereference the actual Pulse, then it needs to do so explicitly, and should also free up the object when finished, to avoid holding any entire blockchain in ram.

```sh
type PulseLink link
```

## InterPulse

Structurally this is a Pulse, however for use within the model system, it is a Pulse that is not fully inflated. The Interpulse class is strictly a subset of the data contained in the Pulse class.
Note that the CID of an Interpulse is exactly the same as the Pulse that created it.

```sh
type InterProvenance struct {
    validators optional &Validators
    turnovers optional &Turnovers
    address Address
    transmissions { String: Tx }        # string addresses mapped to Tx's
}
type InterPulse struct {
    provenance &InterProvenance
    signatures Signatures
}
```
