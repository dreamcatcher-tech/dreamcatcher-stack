/**
 * Datums only store data, they do not modify data.
 * All Datums are defined by a json schema, destribing their state.
 * They can be nested, and can point to any other type of datum.
 * Datums can be schema locked so their format cannot be changed any more.
 * Or they can inherit their schema from a parent.
